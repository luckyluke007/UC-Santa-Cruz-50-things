Our founders wanted the campus to be an antidote 
to the big, faceless educational institutions of the time. In their first show of independence, pioneer faculty members threw letter grades out the window, replacing them with narrative evaluations 
for each student. The goal was to create intense engagement and intellectual risk-taking. While letter grades were reinstituted in 2001 with optional written evaluations available, the idea of learning based on passionate exploration and student-teacher relationships remains a touchstone for UC Santa Cruz.
