Why waste when you can compost? Last year, UC Santa Cruz Dining diverted 638 tons of kitchen and food scraps from the landfill, instead turning the waste into nutrient-rich compost, which was used to replenish the soil and grow more food. The University of California has set a goal of zero waste by 2020, and each campus has developed a Zero Waste Plan. In addition, UC Santa Cruz eats with a conscience. Our dining halls and cafes have already surpassed the UC system-wide goal of ensuring that 20 percent of food purchases are sustainably sourced, with locally grown fruits and vegetables, organic coffee, sustainably caught seafood, and cage-free eggs on our menus. We also are more than halfway to a campus target of 40 percent of food purchases meeting Real Food standards by 2020. Real Food is defined as food that is produced in a fair, humane, and sustainable manner.
