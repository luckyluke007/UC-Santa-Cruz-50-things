Anthropologist Adrienne Zihlman's research has had major impacts on the fields of physical anthropology and human evolution. Her legacy includes a 1970s critique of the "Man the Hunter" paradigm and a radical whole-body approach to the study of evolution that has shaken up a field that heretofore relied solely on fossils. She once organized a meeting of prominent anthropologists to discuss female biology and evolution, which prompted a furor because no men were invited.
