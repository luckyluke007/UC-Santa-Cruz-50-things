Five of our alumni have won Pulitzer Prizes. Washington Post reporter Dana Priest (Merrill '81, politics) won in 2006 and 2008 for reporting on the government's "black site" prisons and the mistreatment of wounded veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Hector Tobar (Oakes '85, Latin American studies/sociology), a Los Angeles Times reporter, shared the 1992 prize for the paper's coverage of the L.A. riots; Laurie Garrett (Merrill '75, biology) won in 1996 for her reporting on the Ebola virus outbreak in Zaire; Annie Wells (College Eight '81, individual major) won in 1997 for her photo of a California flood victim; and Associated Press writer Martha Mendoza (Kresge '88, journalism and education) won in 2000 for an investigative story that uncovered the massacre of South Korean refugees by the U.S. military during the Korean War.
