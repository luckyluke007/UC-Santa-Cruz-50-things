The Weddell seal is amazing. These slippery 
pinnipeds can hold their breath for as long as 90 minutes under the Antarctic sea ice. But our scientists have uncovered something even more amazing: Studying these seals may have implications for understanding stroke and aging in humans. A study led by Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Terrie Williams is looking at how these seals and other deep-diving marine mammals protect themselves from the effects of low levels of oxygen.
