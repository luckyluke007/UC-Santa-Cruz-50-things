We've partnered with UC Hastings College of the Law in a new joint program, the first of its kind in the UC system, that will enable UC Santa Cruz students to earn a bachelor's degree and law degree in six years instead of the usual seven. "3+3 B.A./J.D." program students will complete three years at UC Santa Cruz and then move on to UC Hastings to begin the three-year law curriculum.
