Our Astronomy and Astrophysics Department has a truly "stellar" reputation. Past and current faculty include nine members of the National Academy of Sciences, 10 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, six winners of the Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and five recipients of the American Astronomical' Henry Norris Russell Lectureship. Astronomer Sandra Faber received the National Medal of Science from President Obama, and astronomer Jerry Nelson won the prestigious Kavli Prize in Astrophysics. Faculty expertise covers 
a broad range, including the design of advanced telescopes and instruments; high-energy astrophysics; discovery of exoplanets; galaxy formation and evolution; dark matter and the cosmological history of the universe; and detection of the earliest and most distant galaxies. See also No. 20.
