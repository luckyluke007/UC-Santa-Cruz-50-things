How often do budding writers get a first-person chance to hear from nationally acclaimed writers and poets? At UC Santa Cruz the answer is "regularly," thanks to the Creative Writing Program's popular Living Writers Series. Award-winning authors like Tobias Wolff (This Boy's Life), Karen Joy Fowler (The Jane Austen Book Club), and alumna Reyna Grande (Kresge '99, creative writing/film and video) (Across a Hundred Mountains) have brought information and inspiration to scores of students who are contemplating a writing life.
