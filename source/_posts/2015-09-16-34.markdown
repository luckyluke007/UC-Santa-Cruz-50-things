Organic produce is now available in mainstream grocery stores thanks in part to alumnus Drew Goodman (College Eight '83, environmental studies/environmental design). Goodman and his wife, Myra, built their pioneering company, Earthbound Farm, into the worldâ€™s largest producer of organic produce. In 1986 they became the first company to successfully market prewashed, packaged greens for retail sale, starting a salad revolution and introducing organic produce to big-name retailers.
