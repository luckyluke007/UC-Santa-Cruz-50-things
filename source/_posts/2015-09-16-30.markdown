In case you haven't noticed, there is an undeniable UC Santa Cruz-Saturday Night Live connection. Famed actress Maya Rudolph, a former cast member of SNL who later became known for her lead role in the movie Bridesmaids, was a 1995 graduate of Porter College (art/photography). Alumnus Akiva Schaffer (Oakes '00, film and digital media), who also wrote for SNL, formed the sketch comedy troupe The Lonely Island with childhood friends Jorma Taccone and Andy Samberg-the latter of whom attended UC Santa Cruz before joining the spotlight as an actor and SNL cast member.
