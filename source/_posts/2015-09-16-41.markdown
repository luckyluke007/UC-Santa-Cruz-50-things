Many of our colleges were named for donors: Cowell College is named for Henry Cowell and the Cowell family, former owners of the campus site; Crown College is named after the Crown Zellerbach Paper Company, which gave the initial donation to fund the college; Merrill College is named after Charles E. Merrill Jr., whose father, Charles E. Merrill Sr., was the founder of Merrill Lynch; Porter College is named for Benjamin Porter, grandfather of three University of California benefactors: Porter Sesnon, Barbara Sesnon Cartan, and William T. Sesnon; Kresge College was originally endowed by the Kresge family trust, whose fortune was derived from discount department store chain Kmart; and Oakes College was named in 1975 after philanthropists Roscoe and Margaret Oakes. Colleges Eight, Nine, and Ten are as yet unnamed and still seeking eponymous philanthropists.
