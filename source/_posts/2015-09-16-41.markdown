Many of our colleges were named for donors: 
For example, Cowell College is named for Henry Cowell and the Cowell family, former owners 
of the campus site; Merrill College is named after Charles E. Merrill Jr., whose father, Charles E. Merrill Sr., was the founder of Merrill Lynch; Oakes College was named in 1975 after philanthropists Roscoe and Margaret Oakes; and Kresge College was originally endowed by the Kresge family trust, whose fortune was derived from discount department store chain Kmart. Colleges Eight, Nine, and Ten are as yet unnamed and still seeking eponymous philanthropists.
