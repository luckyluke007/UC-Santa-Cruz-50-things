McHenry Library's Special Collections is, well-really special. In addition to the heavily used Lick Observatory Records, the department holds one of the nation's most significant collections in the history of astronomy, including a one-of-a-kind manuscript of Johannes de Sacrobosco's lunar computations, which was produced in Italy in the early 15th century.
