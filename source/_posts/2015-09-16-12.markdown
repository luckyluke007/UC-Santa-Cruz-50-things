A campus doesn't need to have a football stadium 
or throw tailgate parties to prove its devotion to the sporting life. We have vibrant club and intramural programs, hosting a diversity of teams including Ultimate Frisbee, basketball, softball, soccer, 
flag football, water polo, tennis, volleyball, sailing, and—yes—surfing. Holding true to our countercultural flair, we even sport an active dodgeball team. Eat your heart out, Ben Stiller.
