When is a photo not just a photo? When it is part 
of a field project for our Center for the Study of Pacific War Memories. UC Santa Cruz students are part of a collaborative, social history effort called The Gail Project, led by Associate Professor of History Alan Christy, that is delving into a collection of 200 photos taken by an Army dentist stationed on Okinawa in the 1950s. With the goal of creating an international exhibit, students are uncovering and chronicling an important moment in the history of the relationship between the U.S. and this island, site of one of the bloodiest campaigns in WWII.
