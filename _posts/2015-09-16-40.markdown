Our students have benefited from learning from great visiting artists, including the celebrated short story writer Raymond Carver and acclaimed performer and writer Spalding Gray. Carver taught at the campus for three years. Gray taught a summer session course, an experience that helped spark his interest in dramatic monologue. See also No. 17.
