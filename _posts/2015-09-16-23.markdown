Ocean scientist Jon Zehr discovered an unusual partnership between two microbes that plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, fertilizing the oceans by taking nitrogen from the atmosphere 
and "fixing" it into a form that other organisms can use. One member of this partnership appears to 
be the most widespread nitrogen-fixing organism 
in the oceans. It lacks the genes needed to carry 
out photosynthesis and other essential metabolic pathways, but that's okay because it lives in intimate symbiosis with a tiny single-celled algae. Together, they function almost as a single organism and provide essential nutrients for marine life.
