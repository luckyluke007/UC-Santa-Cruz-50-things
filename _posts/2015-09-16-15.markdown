Researchers with our Santa Cruz Puma Project have outfitted more than 40 mountain lions in the Santa Cruz Mountains with high-tech tracking collars. The collars, innovative devices developed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a UC Santa Cruz engineer and wildlife biologists, bring new awareness of the big cats' range and activities in the wilderness that borders a highly developed and populated area-valuable information for developing better wildlife management plans.
