Our faculty are working hard to make a crucial medical procedure safer than ever. Research on blood stem cells led by biomolecular engineer Camilla Forsberg may lead to improvements in the safety and efficiency of bone marrow transplants. Forsberg is part of our rapidly growing, multidisciplinary Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells.
